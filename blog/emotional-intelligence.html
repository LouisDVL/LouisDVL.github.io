        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the awareness of yours and other peopleâ€™s
          emotions.
        </p>

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is different to IQ in the sense that IQ
          measures cognitive abilities, such as concentration, memory, and such,
          whereas Emotional intelligence measure how in tuned you are with
          emotions.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
          It is very important because we are humans not robots, we are
          emotional creatures and if we are not in tuned with it, then we will
          be very much disconnected when trying to work with others or lead a
          team. It is also very important as it improves our abilities to solve
          problems, which is a critical component into programming.
