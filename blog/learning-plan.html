          <h3>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            - My long term goal is to eventually become a developer for a
            company that has projects that excite me and allow me to find
            satisfaction in my work.

            A description of my own strengths and limitations in relation to my
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            - My strength to learning is that I believe anything is learnable
            for everyone if they put in the effort. I believe that I can learn
            anything given enough time and practice. My limitations is that
            sometimes I can be a bit to unfocused and get side tracked.

            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see
            developed in myself while at EDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I want to learn the ability to become more of people person, I’ve
            always been reserved and shy but I want to be able to get to know
            more people.

            A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I am committing to working well with others and just focus on my
            work. When things are building up and getting to me thenI will just
            take step back and let my diffuse mind solve the problem while I
            relax.

            A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I will seek help after like 2 days have passed of me trying, so I
            will make attempts then if I can’t solve it that day then I will
            take a break and do things that tend to be mundane or things that I
            already know. If the solution doesn’t come to me then I will ask for
            help.

          <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            - My expectation is that they teach us best practice, or tell us
            things that we need improvement on and help me achieve on becoming
            the best developer that I can be.
