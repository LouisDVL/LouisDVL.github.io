            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your
            ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I have learned how self-critical I can get when I face failure or
            adversity. I have been getting better at this however, by just
            simply noticing and letting that thinking go. With this practice I
            notice how productive I have become and how I am able to keep at a
            task for longer.

            What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            - Well the role of empathy is to realise that other people go
            through the same phases as you through learning programming.
            Everyone has moments when they are stuck, or are struggling to learn
            new concepts. It's important for us to be self-aware in these
            moments and less critical because the more we realise that these are
            normal phases the better off we are.

          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            - What surprised me most about the core learning is how important it
            truly is but is hardly taught. When I went to University, these
            aren't topics that are covered.

        <div class="questionGroup">
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            - the most challenging aspect of the core learning would deffinitely
            be the listening and looping. Sometimes I would find my mind
            wandering often about how to respond or trying to recall what was
            said a few moments ago.

            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            - Well I believe it's because the purpose of Enspiral Dev Academy is
            to get us job ready, and since working with people and being a good
            teamate is part of the job it only makes sense that they train us
            within that aspect to.

          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I don't believe that it was a waste of time, I believe that it
            will pay off in the long run, it is also good because it gives you
            some time away from programming, which give you the ground basis
            that you are a person before a programmer.
