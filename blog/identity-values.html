          <h3>
            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - Every day I'm always faced with the decision of working towards my
            long term goals of becoming a software developer or playing video
            games all day instead. I always try to remember that I am doing this
            for my family and the future of my family, so when I look at it that
            way it is no longer a decision. The consequence of this decision is
            ofcourse that I improve at coding and I am just a little bit closer
            to my goal than I was yesterday.

            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - Me being Filipino it has always been family orientated and focused
            on your education and the betterment of the family. I believe that
            is what has driven me.

          <h3>
            strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career
            development.
          </h3>
          <h4>Strengths:</h4>
          <p>
            - I am confident and I persevere within my learning, I know that
            sometimes it may take a while or it may not, but regardless I will
            learn, because I believe in myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            - I always look for ways to improve, I read books like a Mind for
            Numbers by Barbara Oakley to improve my learning, Power of Habits by
            Charles Duhigg because I want to be the best version of myself, to
            not only offer to my future employers but also to the people around
            me.
          </p>
          <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
          <p>
            - Because of my confidence to learn I am always seeking out
            knowledge and sometimes I become unfocused and have this insatiable
            desire for knowledge when I should be mastering a select few.
            Example of this is I should have been mastering JavaScript but got
            distracted by C#, and Python.
          </p>

        <div class="questionGroup">
          <h3>
            My strengths might help me in your learning journey and how they
            might intersect with learning obstacles.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I believe my confidence and perseverance is the most helpful,
            because regardless of what happens I will keep trying and eventually
            I will succeed because the only way I fail is if I no longer try.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionGroup">
          <h3>
            An example from my experience of when I was trying to work
            productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. The
            strategies that I used at that time, how effective they were.
          </h3>
          <p>
            - I've always been a keep your emotions out of work and just get on
            with the job type person. I've never really experienced tension or
            resistance with others but I believe that I will just attempt to
            complete my work and help where ever im needed.
