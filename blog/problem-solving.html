        <h1>Story Time of me problem solving with an over thinking mind</h1>
        <p>
          This week I had come accross a problem that pops up multiple times in
          my life, over thinking. In this weeks excercise of the "Gradebook", a
          simple array and object problem had turned into an initial complicated
          for loop that was not at all neccessary and not at all functioning,
          all in the name of effeciency. If it was past me trying to solve this
          problem, I would've sat and coded for hours, pondering about how I
          could solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucky for me though, that it was not the past me, to solve this
          problem in an elegant way, all I did was step away from my computer
          and take a break. This solves my problem, because as I step away I am
          able to rejuvenate and allow my diffused mind to look at the problem
          in a new way. The result for this was ofcourse with me having less
          hair on my head pulled off, solvng the problem, and last but not least
          creating a function with only a few lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          So whenever you are stuck on a problem, or question, take a break,
          It'll work wonders.
