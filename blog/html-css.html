        <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

        <p>
          In Order for us to understand the distinction between Margin, Border
          and Padding we have to first know what they are.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Margin?</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of margin as a forcefield around the element that
          pushes away the other elements and prevents them from touching it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Border?</h2>
        <p>
          If we were to think of borders, the easiest way to picture it is with
          the use of countries. Each country has a border and so does every
          element. The concept is very much the same, in the sense that if you
          are within proximity of the border then you are within that element.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Padding?</h2>
        <p>
          Padding is like the buffer from the elements content and the border.
          Think of the forests in america before you get to Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>The Difference</h2>
        <p>
          Well as you can see all three of these are different, with the margin
          acting as a security guard for our element and our border acting as a
          parameter line and our padding acting as the fat for our elements.
