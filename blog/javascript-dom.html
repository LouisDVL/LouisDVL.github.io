          <h3>What is the difference between HTML and CSS?</h3>
          <p>
            The difference between HTML and CSS is that we can look at HTML like
            the frame of the house, whereas CSS is the paint, the exterior and
            interior design of the house.

          <h3>Control flows and loops</h3>
          <p>
            Control flows are very simple, we can think of them as small
            decision moments based on certain conditions, for example if it is
            raining then I will bring my umbrella. We can see that the flow of
            action was directed to carrying the umbrella based on the met
            condition of it is raining.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loops are also very simple they can be thought of as mundane
            repetitive tasks that we do. A great example of this is:
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/images/q_auto,f_auto/gigs/3318823/original/Bart_Chalkboard_A_-_FINAL/write-your-text-by-bart-simpson-or-millhouse-on-chalkboard.jpg"
            alt="bart simpson writing on chalkboard"
          />
          <p>
            When you pair loops along with flow control, what you have is a
            mundane reducing process. An example of this is when you have to
            search thousands of data, what you can do is loop through all the
            data and create a flow control that will carry out a task when the
            condition is met.

            What is the dom and an example of how you can interact with it:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Well we can think of the dom without getting to technical is the
            page that we are currently on. We can attach events to items within
            a page or events that occur at certain points, such as music playing
            when the page loads.
          </p>
          <p>You can interact with the dom with the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open inspector tool (CMD + SHIFT + I) - yes I'm on windows</li>
            <li>Go to console</li>
            <li>Enter "let message = document.getElementById("message");"</li>
            <li>Enter "message.innerHTML = "Hello from the dom""</li>
          </ol>
          <span id="message" style="color: red"></span>

            what is the difference between accessing data from Arrays and
            objects?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The difference between accessing data from Arrays and objects is
            that arrays store items with and index, that is why in order to
            retrieve a piece of information from an array us must use and index.
            However when you get data from an object they come in a key value
            pair, that means in order to get a piece of data, you refer to it
            using a key.

          <h3>what is a function and why are they useful</h3>
          <p>
            We can think of functions as a set procedure for excecuting tasks.
            An example of this could be making a cheeseburger, there would be
            set steps for making a cheeseburger, such as first bun, then patty,
            then cheese, then sauce, then other bun, and task complete.
            functions are very useful because they are reusable, instead of
            having to recode the same procedure over and over, we can simply
            call upon the function again and it will execute, (DRY = Don't
            Repeat Yourself).
