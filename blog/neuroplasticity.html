        <h1>What is Neuroplasticity?</h1>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the term used in psychology to say that our brain
          is infact malleable and adapts to challenges or the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>How does the understanding of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
        <p>
          Well it benefits people in understanding that it is possible to
          improve with repeated practice and or recall of information. It also
          provides them with the knowledge of how to improve, because they will
          realise that all skills and knowledge come from repeated practice or
          recall and not something they were born with.
        </p>

        <h2>
          How will I engage in the principles of neuroplasticity for my own
          benefit?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I will engage in the principles of neuroplasticity by using strategies
          such as spaced repetition and spaced recall to ensure that my brain
          retains the knowledge and it is fully embedded as chunks of knowledge
          that I can use.
        </p>

        <h2>How can we improve neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          Well we can improve neuroplasticity by incorporation a more growth
          mindset, and learning the power of the word yet, for example instead
          of saying “I’m not good at math” you can say “I’m not good at math
          yet.”. This implies that as we put forth effort we will become better
          at that activity. We can also prove this to ourselves, by practicing
          skills that we aren’t particularly good at, and as you get better you
          improve your confidence for learning.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
        <p>
          To put it simply growth mindset is the perspective or belief that we
          can improve our intelligence by putting forth effort. In saying that
          we now then see failure not as a negative state but more of a learning
          opportunity and we see challenges not as an indication of inaptitude
          but more of a signal that we are stretching our abilities and allowing
          ourselves to grow.
        </p>
        <h2>Did anything surprise your or change for you?</h2>
        <p>
          Not really, I have been interested in these topics since I was child.
          I have always been curious on how I can improve my learning and
          improve my skills and this was a particular topic that I had come
          across.
        </p>
        <h2>How will I integrate a growth mindset to my learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          I will integrate a growth mindset to my learning journey by
          approaching challenges rather than running away from them, and I will
          also repeatedly practice and recall to improve my abilities.
        </p>
        <h2>
          How will my understanding of a growth mindset and neuroplasticity
          affect my learning plan and strategies?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Well it will improve it in the sense that It will make me more
          confident in approaching challenges. It will also allow me to reframe
          failure as a neutral state or a stepping stone to improving.
        </p>
